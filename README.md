# Analytic Geometry in MATLAB

This collection of classes allows modelling and manipulation of geometric entities in 3D space using Cartesian coordinates in MATLAB.

## Features
- Algebraic representation of coordinated reference frames in a hierarchical structure
- Algebraic representation of points, vectors, and tensors in 3D space
- Coordinate transformations to express the coordinates of a geometric entity in different reference frames
- Geometric operations to alter the coordinates of a geometric entity: translation, rotation, projection


## Installation
Clone this repo to a local folder with the following command in the terminal:
```
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/CarmVarriale/AnalyticGeometry
```

Add it to the MATLAB path with the following command in MATLAB's command window:
```matlab
addpath("path/to/AnalyticGeometry");
```


## Dependencies
External utilities are contained in the `includes` folder, and managed as submodules in the `.gitmodules` file:
- CarmVarriale/[TreeNode](https://github.com/CarmVarriale/TreeNode)


Matlab toolbox dependencies are indicated in the `DEPENDENCIES.txt` file.
This file has been generated by executing the following command provided by the [Dependency Manager for MATLAB](https://github.com/CarmVarriale/DependencyManager)
```matlab
DependencyManager.writeDeps(DependencyManager.findDeps("./**/*.m"));
